📌 README.md for Wi-Fi MAC Spoofing & Bypass Script

# 🚀 Wi-Fi MAC Spoofing & Bypass Script

### **🔹 About This Script**
This script automates the process of:  
✅ Scanning Wi-Fi networks & selecting a target AP.  
✅ Scanning connected devices & selecting a victim client.  
✅ Deauthenticating the client (kicking them off the network).  
✅ Spoofing the target MAC address (bypassing MAC filtering).  
✅ Connecting to the network by requesting an IP.  
✅ Fixing DNS issues if needed.  

This attack **does not crack passwords** but **bypasses MAC filtering** to gain access.

### **⚠ Disclaimer**

🚨 **Unauthorized use on networks you don’t own is illegal!**  
🚨 **Use this script responsibly and only on networks you have permission to test.**

## **💾 Installation & Setup**
### **1️⃣ Install Required Tools**
Make sure you have the following installed:  
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install aircrack-ng macchanger net-tools

2️⃣ Enable Monitor Mode on Your Wi-Fi Adapter

sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

🔹 How to Use
    Run the Script

  sudo python3 script.py

  Select a Wi-Fi Network
        The script scans available APs.
        Enter the BSSID (MAC address) and channel of your target.

  Select a Connected Client
        The script scans for connected devices.
        Enter the MAC address of a victim device to deauthenticate.

   Watch the Magic!
        The script kicks the device off the network, copies its MAC address, and connects as that device.

  Enjoy Your Connection!
        The script requests an IP and fixes DNS issues.
        If successful, you should have internet access.
        Try opening YouTube! 😉

🔹 How This Works

📌 Step 1: Scan for Wi-Fi networks using airodump-ng.
📌 Step 2: Choose an AP and scan for connected devices.
📌 Step 3: Choose a target client and deauthenticate it (aireplay-ng).
📌 Step 4: Spoof the target client’s MAC address (macchanger).
📌 Step 5: Switch Wi-Fi back to Managed Mode (iwconfig).
📌 Step 6: Request an IP address (dhclient).
📌 Step 7: Fix DNS issues if needed (resolv.conf).
🛠 Troubleshooting

1️⃣ No Internet After Spoofing?
Try requesting an IP manually:

sudo dhclient wlan0

2️⃣ Still No Connection?
Switch Wi-Fi to Managed Mode:

sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
sudo dhclient wlan0

3️⃣ DNS Not Resolving?
Set Google DNS:

echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf

🔹 Future Improvements

  🤖 AI-based packet mutation attack (bypassing WPA2 without brute-force)(comming soon).
   🕵️ Evil Twin attack automation (stealing credentials via fake Wi-Fi).
   ⚡ Faster network detection & automation (improving response time).
